#Word Guess Game
###it's basically the childhood game hangman
**Instructions:**
1. Press any key to start
2. Start guessing
3. When you win or lose the score is tallied and new word arrives
4. You can always hit reset game at anytime to reset the score tallies and the game.

### Additional Notes
1. The biggest issue in creating this game was determining guessed letters, whether to display them to the screen as part of the word, or in the section of incorrect letters guessed.

2. After that was solved, having to tie in with how many guesses.

3. Then it was pretty relatively straight forward from then on out.
